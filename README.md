# freecodecamp_java_course
This repository is for me in order to learn Javascript.  Right now I am following the course at Legacy JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.  https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/  The course was moved to Legacy Curriculum on the website, however it is really good for a total beginer.
