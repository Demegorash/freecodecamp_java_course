/* Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication

The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.

myVar = myVar * 5;
will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar *= 5;
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator.


Tests
Waiting:a should equal 25.
Waiting:b should equal 36.
Waiting:c should equal 46.
Waiting:You should use the *= operator for each variable.
Waiting:You should not modify the code above the specified comment.

Exercise statement:

let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

// Only change code below this line
a = a * 5;
b = 3 * b;
c = c * 10; */

// Resolution

let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;

console.log(a, b, c);
