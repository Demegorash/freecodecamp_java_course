/* Use Bracket Notation to Find the Nth Character in a String

You can also use bracket notation to get the character at other positions within a string.

Remember that computers start counting at 0, so the first character is actually the zeroth character.

Example:

const firstName = "Ada";
const secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];
secondLetterOfFirstName would have a value of the string d.

Let's try to set thirdLetterOfLastName to equal the third letter of the lastName variable using bracket notation.

Hint: Try looking at the example above if you get stuck.


Tests
Waiting:The thirdLetterOfLastName variable should have the value of v.
Waiting:You should use bracket notation.

Exercise statement:

// Setup
const lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
const thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName; // Change this line */

// Resolution

const lastName = "Lovelace";

const thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];

console.log(thirdLetterOfLastName);
