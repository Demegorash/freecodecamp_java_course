/* Nest one Array within Another Array

You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

Create a nested array called myArray.

Tests
Waiting:myArray should have at least one array nested within another array.

Exercise statement:

// Only change code below this line
const myArray = []; */

// Resolution

const myArray = [["Cars", 45], ["Boats", 60]];

console.log(myArray);
